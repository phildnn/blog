*This is not a blog.*

### What is this collection of articles’ purpose?

- Not a blog → no opinion pieces or politics
- Instead: I realized, that I learn better, if I have a structure and create output
    - “Writing To Learn” by William Zinssner
- Currently: Learning is merely a university duty and I am subject to a crowding-out effect (almost no intrinsic motivation to do research, learn and dig into fields I find exciting). I am currently a final-year undergrad and I always enjoyed learning so I want to bring the joy in it back
- Additionally: Internships in finance also crowded out → you learn concepts to get through rounds of interviews that all ask the same questions and often times don’t fully understand things. I want to apply the concepts, try to understand more, etc
- So these are rather summaries of my learning process, as I want to shift towards a more sustainable way of consuming and summarizing content
- I want to change my style or learning and doing personal research now and create a streamlined process from consumption to output.
- My working style will be based on the “Zettelkasten Method”
    - Established by Niklas Luhmann, extremely output-driven social scientist who happens to be from the same small town in Germany as me and even went to the same high school about a hundret years ago → ended up in Harvard
    - Basic Idea: Summarizing content pieces, identifying key concepts across works in order to see connections between different fields
    - I find it to be very exciting, as it removes the typial “borders” that we tend to draw between subjects. More information on the method is publicly available, I recommend reading up on it
- As my results and summaries might be helpful for others, I decided to share them here. In case you want to request any pieces of work or are interested in my collection of notes, please reach out via mail or linkedin!
- Please not, nothing up here is meant to be used for scientific work. This is my space of personal learning & growth that I decided to share. However, if you want to discuss things or make additions to one of my articles, please reach out! Looking forward to it

### Technical aspects of it (for the nerds who are interested in it)

- As I mentioned, I am using the Zettelkasten method to keep key concepts and gather ideas / inspirations for output pieces
- There are many great digital tools to use for that. I choose Obisidian, as it is open-source, markdown based and easily adaptable to anyone’s needs.
- I am not sure if I am going to write pieces in Notion, Word, or Obsidian. But no matter my choice, the output should probably be markdown-based (an easy-to-learn, visual language to format pages, more about it can be found here).
- I have not touched VSCode in years, so I will use the easiest method I can find to host a simple CMS based on markdown files. Easy to write, read, etc.
